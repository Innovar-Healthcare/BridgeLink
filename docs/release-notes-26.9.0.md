# BridgeLink 26.9.0 Release Notes

## 🔐 SFTP / jsch Transport Upgrade (IRT-1541, CVE-12)

The File connector's SFTP transport now runs on a current release of
`com.github.mwiede:jsch`, closing out staleness/CVE-hygiene exposure on the
previously bundled version and maximizing distance from future advisories.

| Library | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| jsch (com.github.mwiede) | 0.2.18 | 2.28.5 |

- The File connector's SFTP scheme (`SftpConnection`, `SftpSchemeProperties`) is a
  drop-in upgrade — no API changes, no channel reconfiguration required for
  existing SFTP channels connecting to modern servers.
- jsch retains its **secure-by-default hardened algorithm set**, which excludes a
  handful of weak legacy algorithm families: `diffie-hellman-group14-sha1` key
  exchange, the plain `ssh-rsa` host-key/pubkey signature, the `3des-cbc`/`aes128-cbc`
  ciphers, and the non-ETM `hmac-sha1` MAC. **This hardened posture is unchanged by
  the 2.28.5 upgrade** — these families were already excluded from jsch's defaults
  at 0.2.18 (inherited from the original JCraft-to-mwiede fork migration); the
  version bump itself only adds algorithms (post-quantum kex, OpenSSH certificate
  host keys) and reorders cipher preference (AES-GCM now preferred over AES-CTR).
  It does not remove anything a 0.2.18-based channel relied on.
- **Legacy-server impact:** SFTP channels connecting to older or unpatched servers
  that offer *only* algorithms from the excluded families above may fail
  negotiation with `com.jcraft.jsch.JSchAlgoNegoFailException: Algorithm
  negotiation fail`. This is expected — it is the same secure-by-default behavior
  the connector has always had, not a new regression introduced by this upgrade.
- **Workaround:** each affected channel's per-channel `configurationSettings`
  (the SFTP scheme's advanced Configuration Settings table, piped straight to
  jsch's `session.setConfig()`) can restore connectivity to a specific legacy
  server without weakening the defaults for any other channel.
- For the exact `configurationSettings` key/value pairs to use for each excluded
  algorithm family, see the full configuration runbook:
  **[`docs/sftp-legacy-algorithm-compatibility.md`](./sftp-legacy-algorithm-compatibility.md)**.
